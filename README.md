# INST630-Final Project

This project is intended to create a live weather dashboard that shows different type of weather data. The city it will show is the city where the user currently at. View live demo at https://eedoudou.github.io/INST630-Final/ (require access to location).

The weather data originates from the OpenWeather API, which is a platform that provides weather information. The JS Google Chart library was utilized to construct the weather visualization.

Here's a shot of the live dashboard.
