# INST630-Final Project

This project is intended to create a live weather dashboard that shows different type of weather data. The city it will show is the city where the user currently at.

The weather data originates from the OpenWeather API, which is a platform that provides weather information. The D3.js library was utilized to construct the weather visualization.

Here's a shot of the dashboard.
